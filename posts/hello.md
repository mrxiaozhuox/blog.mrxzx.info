In the past month, I use dioxins re-build my personal website, but I think I need a add a blog page for my website, so I try to find some solution to make this page, I don’t want use any paid server, so I just try to use GitHub repository and GitHub’s api to display my blog, I use api to get file list in the repository, and parse metadata for each file, get some basic info.
